# Industrial Copper Modeling

## 📘 Introduction
This project leverages machine learning to predict the selling price and status of copper. After cleaning the data, filling missing values, and addressing skewness and outliers, I conducted feature engineering and correlation analysis. I developed a Random Forest regression model for predicting selling prices and an Extra Trees classification model for predicting status. Additionally, I created a Streamlit app that allows users to input data and obtain interactive predictions, displaying the results clearly.

## 📘 Overview

### Data Preprocessing
- Loaded the copper CSV into a DataFrame.
- Cleaned and filled missing values, addressed outliers, and adjusted data types.
- Analyzed data distribution and treated skewness
### Feature Engineering
- Assessed feature correlation to identify potential multicollinearity
### Modeling
- Built a regression model for selling price prediction.
- Built a classification model for status prediction.
- Encoded categorical features and optimized hyperparameters.
- Pickled the trained models for deployment.
### Streamlit Application
- Developed a user interface for interacting with the models.
- Predicted selling price and status based on user input.
